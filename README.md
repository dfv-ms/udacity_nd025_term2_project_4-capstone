# udacity_nd025_term2_project_4-capstone

## What's all about?

That's the final project of my Data Science Nanodegree at Udacity.

I'm analyzing data provided by Starbuck's. Starbuck's gives annonymized personal data of fictional customers, several different offers given to the customers and the transaction- and completion-data.

I'm interessed in predicting the success of this offers to arbitrarly users.

So at the end I give a method to predict which type of offer should be made to a person.

## Used Libraries
This project uses python and several libraries:
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
