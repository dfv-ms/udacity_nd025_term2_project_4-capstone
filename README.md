# udacity_nd025_term2_project_4-capstone

## What's all about?

That's the final project of my Data Science Nanodegree at Udacity.

I'm analyzing data provided by Starbuck's. Starbuck's gives annonymized personal data of fictional customers, several different offers given to the customers and the transaction- and completion-data.

I'm interessed in predicting the success of this offers to arbitrarly users.

So at the end I give a method to predict which type of offer should be made to a person.

I've documented the whole process at https://medium.com/@dfv.ms/which-offer-should-be-made-9db167b1262c

## Used Libraries
This project uses python and several libraries:
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn

## Files
### Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb
contains the Jupyter Notebook with all steps
of data processing and analyzing the data. It also runs the ML-process and
provides a function for offer-prediction.

### data/
portfilio.json, profile.json and transcript.json contain the data given by
Udacity/Starbuck's.
